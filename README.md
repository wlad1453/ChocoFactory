# ChocoFactory

In framework of this project a mechatronic packaging system is created. The mechanical part is build with Camozzi pneumatic drives and the electronic part with a PLC on a microprocessor basis. The pneumatic drives are controlled vial pneumatic valves and MOSFET drives.
The feedback of the mechanism (positions of the elements) is given via digital magnetic Hall-efffect sensors.
The software is written on C++ and controls the whole cycle of the mechanism. Moreover for the goal of development the special part of the SW evaluats the entered by operator sycle phases (time points of each movement) and build the right mechanical movements sequence on their basis.
