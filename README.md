# ChocoFactory

In framework of this project a mechatronic packaging szstem is created. The mechanical part of it is build with pneumatic drives of Camozzi and the electronic part on a microprocessor and MOSFET drives. The feedback is given via digital magnetic Hall-efffect sensors.
The software is written on C++ and control the whole cycle of the mechanism. Moreover for the goal of development the SW realizes the evaluation of the put in sycle phases (time points of each movement) and build the right mechanical movements sequence.
