# ChocoFactory

In framework of this project a mechatronic packaging system is created. The mechanical part of it is build with pneumatic drives of Camozzi and the electronic part on a microprocessor basis. The pneumatic drives are controlled vial pneumatic rele and MOSFET drives.
The feedback of the mechanism (positions of the elements) is given via digital magnetic Hall-efffect sensors.
The software is written on C++ and controls the whole cycle of the mechanism. Moreover for the goal of development the special part of the SW evaluats the entered by operator sycle phases (time points of each movement) and build the right mechanical movements sequence on their basis.
